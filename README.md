# Advent of Code

My repository with AoC code

If you want to use my python template:
1. download aoc.py, init.py and template.py from root
2. find your session cookie while logged in to adventofcode.com and copy its value in a file named `user_session_id`
3. install requirements.txt
4. edit aoc.py and change the Config values you want
5. run `python aoc.py init --day=1` for the day you want to work on (the year is taken from the config)
6. implement the solution in the created code.py
7. run doctests with `python aoc.py doctest --day=1`
8. run the solution with `python aoc.py run --day=1`
